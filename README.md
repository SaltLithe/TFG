# PairLeap

Hello, this a college project I designed and coded on my own as the final assignment required to graduate.

# What is PairLeap?

TITLE is an experimental tool to assist in pair programming.

>Pair programming is a design pattern in which two programmers use a single computer to code a solution together. One user will code and the other will review the other's work and point out problems or mistakes

Most of the time, pair programmers will only work in pairs, use only one computer, and will switch roles but not share them, this tool tries to mix this dynamic by allowing small teams to work together in the same project at the same time with their own computer on a local network.

# What can PairLeap do?

These are the features of TITLE summarized:
- 1 : Create and manage workspaces
- 2 : Create/Delete projects in your workspaces
- 3 : Create/Delete folders and class files to your projects
- 4 : Write code in your class files and save your changes
- 5 : Run the code you wrote 
- 6 : Open a session in your computer so other users can code with you
- 7 : Join another user's session to code with them
- 8 : Send your workspace to the users connected to your session
- 9 : Code with your friends and see the changes in real time
- 10 : Run your code together and see real time output

# How to use PairLeap?

- 1 : Download the executable .jar file
- 2 : Run the program, create at least one workspace if you want to create a session or just code on your own
- 3 : To create a session, figure out your ipv4 address and choose an unused port in your computer, you can get your ipv4 address by running ipconfig in cmd. Click on create session and enter the necessary data. Make sure that the other users share your lan network.
- 4 : To join a session you can start the program without a workspace, figure out your ipv4 address and ask your server for their ipv4 and port. Make sure that your server and other users share your lan network.
- 5 : Make  sure that you allow this program to receive and send messages by allowing it through your firewall.
